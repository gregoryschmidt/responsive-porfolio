        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img id="mug" src="assets/images/goodmug1.jpg" alt="Gregory Schmidt">
        <p>I'm an art director and designer at The San Diego Union-Tribune. Currently, I work on the Business section and our entertainment weekly tabloid, Night+Day. I collaborate with reporters, editors, graphic artists and photographers to produce visually appealing pages. My work has been recognized by the Society of News with multiple awards of excellence.</p>
        <p>I was born in Sarasota, Florida. I'm a graduate of Clemson University in South Carolina with a degree in Marketing. Before moving to San Diego in 2002, I lived in Charlotte, North Carolina for 5 years.</p>
        <p>I enjoy running, hiking, long bike rides, listening to music, traveling and drinking wine. I'm also a politics junkie. </p>
